# Bits and Bytes

## Description
Bits and Bytes is a blogging website made for developers. The main page shows you the 6 most recent blogs. You will see in the navbar where you can log in. Once logged in, you can submit a blog. In that blog you can use three back ticks like so: "```" around your code, so once it's published the code can be ran. You can edit or delete your post, as well as comment. You can also edit or delete your comments. Adding tags will make it to where blog posts with that same tag can group together on one page.
